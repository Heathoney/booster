# Welcome to the Boost C++ Libraries



***Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.***

  
  We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library.
  Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad
  spectrum of applications. The http://www.boost.org/users/license.html Boost 
  license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use.


  We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide reference
  implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual
  standardization. Ten Boost libraries are already included in the 
  http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/ C++ Standards Committee's
  Library Technical Report 
  (http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1745.pdf" TR1)
  and will be included in the upcoming revision of the C++ Standard. More
  Boost libraries are proposed for the upcoming 
  http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1810.html  TR2.
