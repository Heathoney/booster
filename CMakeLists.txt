# Some libraries' cmake files don't work well with this cmake file, e.g. because
# - they are generally not designed to support the add_subdirectory workflow at all
# - they define targets with conflicting names (e.g. check)
# - require some additional (internal or external) dependencies

# Those libraries can be excluded here
